# Command Line APP
## *Description*
---
An app that will create a spotify playlist based on top 100 Billboard's selection.
The command line app will prompt the user to input the date they would like to visit 
in this form: (yyyy-mm-dd). After doing so, the app scrapes data from the site for 
the song names and will add them to a new Spotify playlist named the date the user gave.
